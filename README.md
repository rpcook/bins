# Bin Collection Reminder
North Herts Council have made bin collection very complex in mid 2025. Already I have been putting out some form of recycling collection in my dressing gown early one morning, having forgotten to do so the night before.

This project aims to eliminate this in a intiutive manner.

## Genesis
As with most projects, this starts with my wife seeing something on The Socials and asking me if I can make that.

## Overview
Web scraper to determine next collection hosted on a Raspberry Pi. On the day before, flash an LED (of relevant colour). Basic control via push button to dismiss reminder etc.
